# Replication_of_MongoDB_Application_using_python

Created a interactive python application which resembles MyMongoDB.

limitations:
1). Don't change the DB_PATH variable in config.txt file
2). Deletion of attributes in a document is done through primary key.
3). In updation, the attributes to be updated must be present in atleast one document
4). All the database names are converted into lower case whatever may be input
